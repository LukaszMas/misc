# How-To: How to write a good readme and why?

After all, what the heck is this README file? README (as the name suggests:  
"read me") is the first file one should read when starting a new project.  
It's a set of useful information about the project, and a kind of manual.  
A README text file appears in many various places and refers not only  
to programming thou.<sup>([ref][1])</sup>

1. [How to write a good readme for a GitHub project][1]
    - A good README is for other to understand what our code includes and why  
      it's noteworthy
    - But not only, it is also important for ourselves (programmers) to have a  
      decent documented project, so in the event of coming back to it we will  
      be able to easily pick it up where we left off.

    - Use `grip` to locally render readme files before sending off to GitHub
    - Sample usage:
        - `grip README.md`
    - You can call `grip` on any Markdown file to preview it exactly the way  
      it will be displayed in `GitHub` (includes extended markdown features)
