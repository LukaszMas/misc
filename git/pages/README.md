# How-To: Create GitHub hosted Pages (simple website)

This guide is laser-focused on one thing: showing how to get a working  
informational website up and running as fast as possible using GitHub Pages,  
using only the GitHub website. Informational website is an informal term  
meaning that the emphasis is on function (structured text with simple  
formatting, links, images) and not form (intricate page design). It goes step  
by step from the very beginning and assumes very little knowledge on your part.<sup>([ref][1])</sup>
